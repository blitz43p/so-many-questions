# So Many Questions!

This is a project for beginners to learn the basics of web development with HTML and JavaScript

![So Many Questions!](/demo.png?raw=true)

The "Issues" outlined in this repository are in ordered steps for completing the project.  Once all issues have been completed, you should have a fully working program!

This project is simple:  The user types a simple yes/no question, and an automatic answer is returned.  The responses are stored temporarily in the browser's storage, and the user can Like or Delete a response if they so choose.

This is intended to help beginners understand some basic to intermediate concepts in JavaScript (and DOM manipulation), and also doubles as a way to help me with code reviews.

I welcome all contributions! Just fork the respository, take a look at the issues, and submit a PR for each issue you work on.  Don't forget to put the issue # in your PR!


> Note: This repository is meant to be mostly empty so it doesn't give away any answers.  It does, however, give a lot of hints on how to complete the project. :)


I believe that practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make you a heck of a lot better than you were before. So please give it a try, and don't give up!

### To get started:

First, fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.

Next, come back to this repository and take a look at the Issues page.  

Start with Issue #1, create a new branch in your repository for Issue #1, make your changes and commit them, and once you're finished submit your Pull Request.  Then move onto Issue #2, repeat the steps above, and continue until you have made a Pull Request for each issue. That's it!  Have fun :)
